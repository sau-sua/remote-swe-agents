 * The worker measures each turn's context-window utilisation (a single
 * normalised `contextUsagePercentage` populated by the inference backend
 * backends — see `TurnResult`) and surfaces it back to the MODEL via a dynamic
 * per-turn "environment" block. The model can then decide, on its own, to hand
 * its work over to a fresh successor session (by calling the `createNewSession`
 * tool with `role: 'successor'`) before its context fills up.
 *
 * There is intentionally NO orchestrator-side mechanical auto-fire: handover is
 * a decision the agent makes, not something the runtime forces at a fixed
 * percentage. This module therefore only builds the informational block; it
 * performs no session creation or reparenting itself.

 * It is NOT a hard trigger — the model decides when to hand over. Presented as
 * a rule-of-thumb so the agent has time to wrap up (persist state, summarise,
 * reach a clean stopping point) and spin up a successor before it runs into
 * middle-out truncation or a context-overflow error.
 *
 * ~80% leaves roughly a fifth of the window (~40k tokens on a 200k model) as
 * head-room to compose a handover message and let the successor start cleanly.
