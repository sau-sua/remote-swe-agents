/**
 * Internal messageType used to mirror every message that was actually
 * delivered to the USER (Slack / web push / last-message preview), so the
 * user-facing delivery path can dedup against its own recent history — exactly
 * mirroring how `communicationLog` lets the agent-to-agent path
 * (`agent-messaging.ts`) suppress resurrection re-emits.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * When a turn fails at the inference stage (the inference backend `-32603` "Internal error"
 * / prompt timeout) AFTER it has already delivered a user-facing message, the
 * orchestrator schedules an auto-retrigger (`systemRetrigger`) and re-runs the
 * turn from the top. the inference backend resumes its own session memory via
 * `session/load`, so the model re-decides to call `sendMessageToUser` and/or
 * re-emits the same end-of-turn text. The user-facing delivery functions had
 * NO duplicate suppression (unlike the agent-messaging path), so the user
 * received the same message twice.
 *
 * This log + the {@link shouldSuppressUserDelivery} predicate close that gap at
 * the single user-facing choke-point.
 *
 * ## Filtering
 *
 * `userDeliveryLog` items are UI/internal mirrors and MUST never enter an LLM
 * context. They are excluded from `getConversationHistory` (and
 * `middleOutFiltering`) by default, alongside `communicationLog`.

 * accumulating them. 1 hour comfortably covers the 5-minute dedup window with

/**
 * Decide whether an about-to-be-persisted `toolUse` for a message-delivery
 * tool should be suppressed because an (almost) identical message-delivery
 * `toolUse` was ALREADY persisted within the dedup window.
 *
 * ## Why this is separate from {@link shouldSuppressUserDelivery}
 *
 * The Slack/push delivery path (the MCP `sendMessageToUser` handler) and the
 * webapp `toolUse` persist+emit path (the worker's inference backend `onEvent`) run
 * in DIFFERENT processes for external inference sessions. If both deduped against — and
 * wrote to — the same `userDeliveryLog`, the handler's same-turn record could
 * race ahead of the `onEvent` check and falsely suppress the FIRST persist
 * (the worst regression: nothing rendered in the webapp).
 *
 * So this predicate instead dedups against the worker's OWN authoritative
 * record — the previously persisted `toolUse` items. Within a turn there is
 * exactly one persist per `tool_call`, so the first delivery can never be
 * suppressed; on an auto-retrigger turn the previous turn's `toolUse` is
 * already in DynamoDB and the re-emit is caught. This directly targets the
 * observed incident (two `toolUse:sendMessageToUser` rows in history).
 *
 * Reuses the same conservative heuristic as the rest of the dedup family
 * (short messages never deduped, 5-min window, bigram Jaccard ≥ 0.3). Caller
 * MUST gate on {@link isMessageDeliveryToolName} first — this only inspects
 * prior message-delivery `toolUse` items, never other tools.
